# Date Class Project Overview

This project creates a simple Date class in Java that lets you work with calendar dates. The Date class handles months, days, and years, making sure they match real calendar dates.

## What Our Project Does

### The Date Class
- Stores day, month, and year numbers
- Checks if dates are real (like making sure February doesn't have 30 days)
- Handles leap years correctly (when February has 29 days)
- Can tell you what day of the week a date falls on (like Monday or Tuesday)
- Can find how many days are between two dates
- Shows dates in a nice way like "January 1, 2023"
- Can compare dates to see which one comes first

### The Main Program
- Shows how to create dates
- Tests what happens with fake dates (like February 30)
- Updates dates and shows the results
- Finds what day of the week different dates are
- Calculates how many days are between dates
- Puts dates in order from earliest to latest
- Lets you type in your own date to test

## How It Works
The program uses Java's built-in calendar tools to help with some of the harder date math. When you run the program, it walks through different examples to show all the things the Date class can do.

This project is great for beginners to learn about Java programming while creating something useful that handles real-world information like calendar dates.# Date Class Project Overview
